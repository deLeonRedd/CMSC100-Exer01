Steps on how to create GitHub page
My key takeaways from this exercise are that we should be careful when creating webpages since HTML and CSS are not programming languages therefore errors are not likely to be reported by the text editor. Also, creating a webpage takes time and should not be rushed, if we want to create an accessible and aesthetic website.

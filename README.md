How to create github pages
1. Create a repository for the site.
2. It is important to name the html file as "index.html" so that it can find where to start the webpage from. Do not forget the read me file.
3. Navigate to the settings tab of the repository, go to the code and production section, then click the pages tab.
4. Select root and main branch.
5. Wait for the website to build and deploy then get the link from the pages tab.
   
My key takeaways from this exercise are that we should be careful when creating webpages since HTML and CSS are not programming languages therefore errors are not likely to be reported by the text editor. Also, creating a webpage takes time and should not be rushed, if we want to create an accessible and aesthetic website.
